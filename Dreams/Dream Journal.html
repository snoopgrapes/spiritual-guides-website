        <div class="dream-section">
            <h3>Dream Summary:</h3>
            <p>I was riding an old mountain bike as a passenger. My friend was steering and pedaling the bike, which had no seat. At our destination, I realized I had no keys to get home or my mobile phone. I wasn't even sure where home was.</p>

            <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
            
            <p class="symbol-title">üö≤ Riding as Passenger on Old Bike:</p>
            <div class="interpretation">
                Feeling like you're not in control of your direction. The "old bike" might represent an outdated path, and the missing seat suggests discomfort or instability in your current situation.
            </div>
            
            <p class="symbol-title">üë´ Friend Steering:</p>
            <div class="interpretation">
                You may be relying on someone else to make decisions or provide momentum in your life. Could reflect passivity or dependence in a real-life relationship.
            </div>
            
            <p class="symbol-title">üîë Missing Keys/Phone:</p>
            <div class="interpretation">
                Keys symbolize access or solutions‚Äîlosing them may mean feeling helpless. No phone could represent disconnection from others or your goals.
            </div>
            
            <p class="symbol-title">üè† Uncertain About Home:</p>
            <div class="interpretation">
                "Home" often represents your sense of self or security. Not knowing where it is might reflect feeling lost or in transition.

            <h3>Reflection Questions:</h3>
            <p class="questions">
                ‚Ä¢ Where in life do I feel like a passive passenger?<br>
                ‚Ä¢ What "tools" (keys/phone) do I feel I'm missing?<br>
                ‚Ä¢ What does "home" mean to me right now?<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Am I comfortable with how much control I have over my direction?
