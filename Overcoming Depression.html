        <h1>Overcoming Depression – God Is Near to the Brokenhearted</h1>
        
        <p>In moments of despair, God draws near to those who are hurting. Depression can feel isolating, but Scripture reminds us that we are not alone—God sees, hears, and comforts the brokenhearted.</p>
        
        <h2>1. God Is Close in Our Pain</h2>
        <div class="verse">
            <strong>Psalm 34:18 (ESV)</strong><br>
            "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit."
        </div>
        <p>Depression can make us feel abandoned, but God promises His nearness. He doesn’t dismiss our pain; He meets us in it. Even when we can’t sense Him, His presence is a reality, not based on feelings.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Speak Truth to Your Soul</h2>
        <div class="verse">
            <strong>Psalm 42:5 (ESV)</strong><br>
            "Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise Him, my salvation and my God."
        </div>
        <p>The psalmist acknowledges his despair but redirects his focus to God’s faithfulness. Depression often lies to us, so we must combat it with truth. Even in the struggle, we can choose to hope in God’s unchanging character.</p>
        
        <h2>3. More Encouraging Scriptures</h2>
        <div class="verse">
            <strong>Isaiah 41:10</strong><br>
            "Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God."
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <strong>Matthew 11:28</strong><br>
            "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <strong>2 Corinthians 1:3-4</strong><br>
            "Blessed be the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction..."
        </div>
        
        <div class="closing">
            <p>Depression may feel overwhelming, but God walks with us through the valley. Hold onto His promises, lean on His people, and trust that healing comes in His presence. <strong>You are not alone—your Heavenly Father is near.</strong></p>
