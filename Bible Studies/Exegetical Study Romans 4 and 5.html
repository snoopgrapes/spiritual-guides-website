        <div class="intro">
            Romans 4 and 5 are pivotal chapters in Paul's letter to the Romans, focusing on the doctrine of <strong>justification by faith</strong> using Abraham as the primary example (ch. 4) and the blessings that flow from justification (ch. 5). These chapters build on Paul's argument that righteousness comes through faith, not works (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A21-31&version=ESV" target="_blank">Rom 3:21-31</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 3:21-31</strong><br>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe...</span></span>), and they transition into the believer's assurance and hope in Christ.

        <h2>I. Exegesis of Romans 4: Justification by Faith Illustrated in Abraham</h2>

        <h3>A. Abraham Justified by Faith, Not Works (4:1-8)</h3>
        <p><strong>4:1-3</strong>: Paul introduces Abraham, the Jewish patriarch, to prove that justification is by faith, not works.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quoting <span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15%3A6&version=ESV" target="_blank">Genesis 15:6</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 15:6</strong><br>And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.</span></span>, Paul shows that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness <strong>before</strong> he was circumcised (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 17</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 17</strong><br>When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless..."</span></span>).</li>
            <li>If Abraham were justified by works, he could boast (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A2&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:2</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:2</strong><br>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</span></span>), but Scripture says he was justified by faith (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:3</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:3</strong><br>For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."</span></span>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4:4-8</strong>: Paul contrasts <strong>wages (works)</strong> with <strong>grace (faith)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Works-righteousness</strong> is earned (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:4</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:4</strong><br>Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.</span></span>), but <strong>faith-righteousness</strong> is a gift (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A5&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:5</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:5</strong><br>And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness...</span></span>).</li>
            <li>David's testimony (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+32%3A1-2&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ps 32:1-2</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Psalm 32:1-2</strong><br>Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity...</span></span>) reinforces that forgiveness is by grace, not merit (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A6-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:6-8</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:6-8</strong><br>David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven..."</span></span>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Abraham's Justification Before Circumcision (4:9-12)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4:9-10</strong>: Abraham was justified <strong>before</strong> circumcision (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 15</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 15</strong><br>After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."</span></span> → <span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 17</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 17</strong><br>When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless..."</span></span>), proving that circumcision was a <strong>sign</strong>, not the <strong>cause</strong>, of his righteousness.</li>
            <li><strong>4:11-12</strong>: Abraham is the father of <strong>all who believe</strong> (Jew and Gentile), not just the circumcised.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. The Promise Comes by Faith, Not Law (4:13-17)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4:13-15</strong>: The promise to Abraham (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 12</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 12</strong><br>Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you..."</span></span>, <span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15&version=ESV" target="_blank">15</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 15</strong><br>After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."</span></span>, <span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17&version=ESV" target="_blank">17</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 17</strong><br>When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless..."</span></span>) was based on faith, not law-keeping.
                <ul>
                    <li>If inheritance came by law, faith would be void (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A14&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:14</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:14</strong><br>For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.</span></span>).</li>
                    <li>The law brings wrath because no one keeps it perfectly (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A15&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:15</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:15</strong><br>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</span></span>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>4:16-17</strong>: Salvation is by grace through faith so that it may be guaranteed to all believers.
                <ul>
                    <li>Abraham is the father of many nations (fulfilling <span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17%3A5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 17:5</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 17:5</strong><br>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.</span></span>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>D. Abraham's Faith as a Model for Believers (4:18-25)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4:18-22</strong>: Despite human impossibility (old age, barrenness), Abraham believed God's promise (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15%3A5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 15:5</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 15:5</strong><br>And he brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</span></span>).
                <ul>
                    <li>His faith did not weaken (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A19-20&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:19-20</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:19-20</strong><br>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God...</span></span>).</li>
                    <li>He was <strong>fully convinced</strong> that God would fulfill His word (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A21&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:21</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:21</strong><br>Fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</span></span>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>4:23-25</strong>: Abraham's faith is a pattern for Christians.
                <ul>
                    <li>We are justified by believing in Christ's resurrection (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A24-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:24-25</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:24-25</strong><br>It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</span></span>).</li>
                    <li>Jesus was <strong>delivered for our offenses</strong> and <strong>raised for our justification</strong> (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A25&version=ESV" target="_blank">4:25</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 4:25</strong><br>Who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</span></span>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>II. Exegesis of Romans 5: The Blessings of Justification</h2>

        <h3>A. Peace with God Through Justification (5:1-5)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5:1</strong>: Justification brings <strong>peace with God</strong> (reconciliation, not just a truce).</li>
            <li><strong>5:2</strong>: We have <strong>access by faith into grace</strong> and hope of glory.</li>
            <li><strong>5:3-5</strong>: Suffering produces endurance, character, and hope (because of God's love poured out by the Spirit).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Christ's Death for the Ungodly (5:6-11)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5:6-8</strong>: Christ died for us <strong>while we were still sinners</strong> (not because we were righteous).
                <ul>
                    <li>Rarely would someone die for a righteous person, but Christ died for the ungodly (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A7-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">5:7-8</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Romans 5:7-8</strong><br>For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span></span>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5:9-11</strong>: Since we are justified by His blood, we are saved from wrath and reconciled to God.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Adam and Christ: Two Representatives (5:12-21)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5:12-14</strong>: Sin entered through <strong>Adam</strong>, bringing death to all (<span class="verse-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Gen 3</a><span class="verse-popup"><strong>Genesis 3</strong><br>Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"...</span></span>).
                <ul>
                    <li>Death reigned even before the Law (from Adam to Moses).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5:15-17</strong>: <strong>Adam's trespass</strong> brought condemnation, but <strong>Christ's obedience</strong> brings justification.
                <ul>
                    <li>The gift (grace) is greater than the trespass (sin).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5:18-19</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One trespass (Adam)</strong> → <strong>condemnation for all</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>One act of righteousness (Christ)</strong> → <strong>justification for all who believe</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5:20-21</strong>: The Law increased sin's visibility, but grace abounded more.
                <ul>
                    <li>Sin leads to death, but grace leads to eternal life through Christ.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Romans 4 and 5 present a robust theology of <strong>justification by faith</strong>, using Abraham as the prime example and contrasting Adam's sin with Christ's redemptive work. These chapters assure believers of their standing in grace and the certainty of God's promises.</p>
