        <h1>Bible Study: Unforgiveness in Marriage</h1>
        <p class="theme">"Unforgiveness is poison to marriage."</p>
        <p>Key Scriptures: Colossians 3:12-14, Matthew 18:21-22</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Unforgiveness is like a slow-acting poison in marriageâ€”it breeds resentment, erodes trust, and destroys intimacy. God calls us to forgive as He has forgiven us, and this is especially vital in marriage. Let's explore what Scripture says about forgiveness and its necessity for a healthy, God-honoring marriage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. The Command to Forgive</h2>
        <div class="scripture">
            <p><strong>Colossians 3:12-14</strong> - "Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="discussion-points">
            <h3>Discussion Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forgiveness is a choice, not just a feeling.</strong> We are commanded to "clothe ourselves" with virtues like compassion and forgiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Marriage requires bearing with one another.</strong> No spouse is perfect; patience and humility are essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Love binds everything together.</strong> Without forgiveness, love cannot thrive, and unity is broken.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Reflection Question:</h3>
            <p><em>Is there an unresolved offense in your marriage that you need to release to God?</em></p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. The Extent of Forgiveness</h2>
        <div class="scripture">
            <p><strong>Matthew 18:21-22</strong> - "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="discussion-points">
            <h3>Discussion Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forgiveness has no limits.</strong> Jesus calls us to forgive repeatedly, just as God forgives us (Ephesians 4:32).</li>
                <li><strong>Unforgiveness leads to bitterness.</strong> Hebrews 12:15 warns that a "root of bitterness" can defile a marriage.</li>
                <li><strong>Forgiveness is a reflection of God's grace.</strong> Just as we are forgiven much, we must forgive much (Luke 7:47).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Reflection Question:</h3>
            <p><em>Are you keeping a record of wrongs in your marriage? How can you choose to release it today?</em></p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. The Consequences of Unforgiveness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hinders prayer (Mark 11:25)</strong> â€“ Unforgiveness blocks our spiritual growth and intimacy with God.</li>
            <li><strong>Destroys unity (1 Peter 3:7)</strong> â€“ A marriage cannot thrive when resentment is present.</li>
            <li><strong>Gives the devil a foothold (Ephesians 4:26-27)</strong> â€“ Anger and unforgiveness open doors to strife and division.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h3>Practical Step:</h3>
            <p><em>Write down any grievances you're holding onto, pray over them, and choose to forgiveâ€”even if it's a process.</em></p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <div class="prayer">
        <h3>Closing Prayer</h3>
        <p>"Lord, help us to forgive as You have forgiven us. Remove any bitterness from our hearts and fill our marriage with Your love, grace, and unity. Teach us to bear with one another in patience and to always extend mercy. In Jesus' name, Amen."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="final-thought">
        <p>"To err is human; to forgive, divine." (Alexander Pope) In marriage, forgiveness isn't optionalâ€”it's a divine necessity. Let go of the poison of unforgiveness and embrace the freedom of grace.</p>
