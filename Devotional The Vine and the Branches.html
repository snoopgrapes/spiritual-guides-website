    <h1>üåø Day 1: The Vine and the Branches</h1>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úùÔ∏è</span> Theme</h2>
    <p>Understanding our complete dependence on Christ</p>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üìñ</span> Scripture</h2>
    <div class="scripture">
      <p><strong>John 15:1-5 (ESV)</strong></p>
      <p>"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üîç</span> Focus</h2>
    <div class="focus-box">
      <p><strong>What does it mean that Jesus is the vine and we are the branches?</strong></p>
      <p>In this powerful metaphor, Jesus reveals our fundamental relationship with Him. Just as branches draw all their life, nourishment, and fruit-bearing capacity from the vine, we are completely dependent on Christ for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our spiritual life and vitality</li>
        <li>Our ability to produce godly fruit</li>
        <li>Our very existence as Christians</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Without connection to the vine, branches wither and die. Without abiding in Christ, our spiritual lives become dry and fruitless. This passage calls us to recognize our absolute need for Jesus in every aspect of our lives.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úã</span> Practice</h2>
    <div class="practice-box">
      <p><strong>Throughout the day, pause and say:</strong> "I am connected to the True Vine."</p>
      <p>Set reminders on your phone or write this phrase on sticky notes as visual cues. Each time you say it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pause for a moment of stillness</li>
        <li>Visualize your connection to Christ</li>
        <li>Ask: "Am I drawing my strength from Him in this moment?"</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üôè</span> Prayer</h2>
    <div class="prayer-box">
      <p>"Jesus, help me understand my complete dependence on You. Open my eyes to see the ways I try to live independently from You. Teach me what it truly means to abide in You as my source of life. When I'm tempted to rely on my own strength, remind me that apart from You, I can do nothing. May my connection to You, the True Vine, grow stronger each day. Amen."</p>
