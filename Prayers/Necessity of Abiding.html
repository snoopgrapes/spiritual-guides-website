        <h1>The Necessity of Abiding</h1>
        
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        
        <p>You’ve called me to abide in Christ—not as an option, but as a necessity for life. 
        <span class="scripture">"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away like a branch and withers." (John 15:6)</span></p>
        
        <p>Forgive me for the times I’ve tried to live on my own strength, forgetting that apart from Jesus, I can bear no eternal fruit. 
        <span class="scripture">"As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me." (John 15:4)</span></p>
        
        <p>Root me deeply in Your Word. Let Your truth saturate my thoughts, so that I naturally dwell in Your presence. 
        <span class="scripture">"If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples." (John 8:31)</span></p>
        
        <p>When storms come, hold me fast. When distractions arise, draw me back. Make abiding in You my first instinct, not my last resort.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus, You are my true Vine—the source of all life, joy, and purpose. Teach me what it means to <em>remain</em> in You moment by moment. 
        <span class="scripture">"Whoever abides in Me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit." (John 15:5)</span></p>
        
        <p>I surrender my self-sufficiency. Keep me tethered to You, Lord, for I know that to abide is to truly live.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of Jesus, my Life and my Hope,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
