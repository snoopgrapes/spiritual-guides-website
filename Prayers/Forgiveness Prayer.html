        <h1>A Prayer of Forgiveness</h1>
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        <p>I come before you today with a humble heart. Your Son, Jesus, taught us a powerful lesson about forgiveness in the parable of the unforgiving servant. Just as you have forgiven me for my countless debts, help me to forgive those who have wronged me.</p>
        <p>Lord, it is so easy to hold onto anger and resentment. My heart can become hardened, and I find it difficult to release the hurt. But your word reminds me that if I do not forgive my brother from my heart, you will not forgive me.</p>
        <p>Give me the grace to release the anger and hurt I hold towards others. Help me to remember the immense debt you have canceled for me through the sacrifice of your Son. Fill my heart with your love so that I may be a channel of your forgiveness to others.</p>
        <p>In the name of Jesus, who taught us to forgive without limit, I pray.</p>
        <div class="amen">Amen.</div>
