    <h1>A Biblical Prayer for Uprooting Bitterness</h1>

    <p>Heavenly Father,</p>

    <p>I approach Your grace-filled throne with a humble heart. Thank You for Your unwavering love and fresh mercies each day.</p>

    <p>Lord, I confess the root of bitterness within me. It has poisoned my spirit, defiled my thoughts, and hurt my relationships, especially with [mention the person or situation, e.g., "my wife," or "those who have wronged me"]. Forgive this sin, O God, for it opposes the peace and holiness You call me to.</p>

    <p>I stand "under grace," knowing "sin will have no dominion over me." I cannot remove this bitterness alone; only Your transformative grace, given through Christ, can. By Your Holy Spirit, expose and extract every trace of this bitterness from my soul.</p>

    <p>Replace this bitter root with Your spirit of gentleness, kindness, and compassion. Help me to forgive as You have forgiven me. Let me see [the person/situation] through Your merciful eyes, not through my hurt.</p>

    <p>I renounce bitterness's hold on me. By Your grace, I release all pain, anger, and desire for retribution. Fill me with Your divine love that "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7). Empower me to actively pursue peace with everyone and the holiness essential to seeing You.</p>

    <p>Thank You, Father, for hearing me. I trust Your power to heal and renew me. May my life reflect the freedom and forgiveness found in Your Son.</p>

    <p class="closing">In Jesus' mighty name,</p>
    <p class="closing">Amen.</p>
