    <h2>üôè End-of-Week Prayer</h2>
    <div class="daily-rhythm">
      <p><em>Heavenly Father,</em></p>
      
      <p>As I come to the end of this week of emotional renewal, I thank You for walking with me through each day's lessons. You have shown me Your truth that sets me free from destructive emotions.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the anger</strong> that flares within me, thank You for the wisdom of James 1:19-20 and Ephesians 4:26-27, reminding me that human anger doesn't produce Your righteousness. Help me to pause and consider Your perspective before reacting.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the depression</strong> that sometimes overwhelms me, I cling to Your promise in Psalm 34:18 that You are near to the brokenhearted. Like David in Psalm 42:5, I will hope in You even when my soul is cast down.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the fear and anxiety</strong> that plague me, I claim 2 Timothy 1:7 - You have given me a spirit of power, love, and self-control. As Philippians 4:6-7 instructs, I bring every worry to You in prayer, receiving Your peace that guards my heart.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the frustrations</strong> of daily life, Proverbs 14:29 teaches me that patience comes from wisdom. Help me remember Ecclesiastes 7:8 - that the end of a matter is better than its beginning, and to trust Your perfect timing.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the hurts</strong> I've carried, I receive Your healing promised in Psalm 147:3. As 1 Peter 5:7 says, I cast all my anxieties on You because You care for me. Mend my broken places with Your love.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the joy</strong> I long for, John 15:11 reminds me that true joy comes from abiding in You. Let the joy of the Lord be my strength (Nehemiah 8:10) as I serve others in Your name.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For the peace</strong> I need, Isaiah 26:3 promises perfect peace to those whose minds are stayed on You. Let the peace of Christ rule in my heart (Colossians 3:15) in every circumstance.</p>
      
      <p>Lord, continue the work You've begun in me. Help me to take every thought captive to obey Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5), to be transformed by the renewing of my mind (Romans 12:2), and to walk in the Spirit's fruit (Galatians 5:22-23).</p>
      
      <p>May my emotions no longer control me, but rather be submitted to Your truth. Teach me to number my days that I may gain a heart of wisdom (Psalm 90:12).</p>
      
      <p><em>In Jesus' name, Amen.</em></p>
