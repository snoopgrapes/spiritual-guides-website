        <h1>Abiding and Obeying</h1>
        
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        
        <p>You’ve shown me that <span class="emphasis">abiding</span> and <span class="dual-emphasis">obeying</span> are inseparable—like roots and fruit in the life of faith. 
        <span class="scripture">"If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love." (John 15:10)</span></p>
        
        <p>Guard me from two errors: trying to obey <span class="dual-emphasis">without abiding</span> (which leads to pride), or claiming to abide <span class="emphasis">without obeying</span> (which reveals deception). 
        <span class="scripture">"Whoever says 'I know him' but does not keep his commandments is a liar." (1 John 2:4)</span></p>
        
        <p>Make Your commands precious to me—not as burdens, but as the natural overflow of abiding in Christ. 
        <span class="scripture">"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome." (1 John 5:3)</span></p>
        
        <p>When obedience feels costly, remind me that You always provide the grace to do what You require. 
        <span class="scripture">"I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit." (John 15:5)</span></p>
        
        <p>Let my life prove that true obedience flows from <span class="emphasis">connection</span>, not compulsion—from <span class="emphasis">love</span>, not law.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus, unite these truths in me: To abide is to obey, and to obey is to abide.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of the Obedient Son who abides in the Father's love,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
