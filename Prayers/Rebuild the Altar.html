        <h1>Rebuild the Altar</h1>
        
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        
        <p>Today, I come before You with a heart ready to surrender. Your Word says in <span class="scripture">"Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God." (Romans 12:1)</span>. But Lord, I confess that <span class="dual-emphasis">bitterness</span> and <span class="dual-emphasis">sin</span> have broken down the altar of worship in my life.</p>
        
        <p>Forgive me for the times I’ve allowed resentment to take root, for the moments I’ve held onto my pain instead of releasing it to You. Cleanse me, Lord, and help me tear down every wall that has kept me from <span class="emphasis">wholehearted devotion</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I choose to <span class="emphasis">rebuild the altar</span>. I lay down my hurts, my past, and my struggles upon it as an offering. I rededicate my body, my mind, and my story to You. <span class="dual-emphasis">I am Yours.</span></p>
        
        <p>Transform me by the renewing of my mind. <span class="scripture">"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind." (Romans 12:2)</span>. Let my worship be pure, my heart steadfast. May my life be a living sacrifice, a fragrant offering before You.</p>
        
        <p>Fill me with Your Spirit, that every word, every thought, and every action would honor You. Rebuild the altar of my heart, Lord, and let the fire of Your presence never fade.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of Jesus, who makes all things new,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
