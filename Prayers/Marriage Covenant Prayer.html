    <h1>Prayer for the Sacredness of Marriage Covenant</h1>
    
    <div class="prayer">
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        
        <p>I come before You in awe of Your design for marriage—a holy covenant, not merely a human contract. You ordained it from the beginning, declaring, 'What God has joined together, let no one separate' (Mark 10:9). Lord, I confess any ways I've dishonored this covenant, treating it as disposable or forgetting its sacred weight.</p>
        
        <p>You remind us in Malachi that marriage is a 'covenant partnership' (Malachi 2:14), sealed not just by vows but by Your Spirit. Forgive me for the times I've hardened my heart, prioritized my pride, or allowed strife to weaken the unity You designed. Where I've failed to love as Christ loves the Church, wash me clean and renew my reverence for this bond.</p>
        
        <p>God, guard my marriage against the enemy's schemes to divide. Help me to 'hold fast' to my spouse (Malachi 2:15) with faithfulness, tenderness, and perseverance. When trials come, remind me that You are the third cord in our union (Ecclesiastes 4:12), strong enough to restore what's broken.</p>
        
        <p>I declare today: No weapon formed against this covenant will prosper. Clothe us in humility, cover us in grace, and teach us to fight for each other, not against one another. Let our marriage reflect Your covenant love—unbreakable, sacrificial, and full of mercy.</p>
        
        <p class="amen">In Jesus' name, the perfect Bridegroom, Amen.</p>
