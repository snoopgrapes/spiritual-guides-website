    <h1>A Prayer for the Removal of Bitterness</h1>

    <p>Heavenly Father,</p>

    <p>I come before You with a humble and honest heart. Thank you for the revelations in Your Word, which are a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. Thank you for the grace You have poured out, a grace so powerful that sin no longer has dominion over me.</p>

    <p>Lord, Your Word calls me to "strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see You." I confess today that I have not been striving for peace, especially with my wife. A "root of bitterness" has taken hold in my heart, and it is causing trouble and defiling my relationship with her and, by extension, my relationship with You.</p>

    <p>I recognize that this bitterness is a poison, a manifestation of the sin that Your grace has conquered. I have been failing to fully grasp and live in the grace You have so freely given me in Christ. I ask for Your forgiveness for harboring this resentment and for allowing a spirit of bitterness to take root instead of a spirit of love and forgiveness.</p>

    <p>I ask in Jesus' name that You would expose this root of bitterness in my heart. Pull it out, Lord, by the power of Your Holy Spirit. Replace it with a spirit of gentleness, kindness, and grace. Help me to see my wife not through the lens of my bitterness, but through the eyes of Your love and mercy.</p>

    <p>Remind me, Father, that I am no longer under the law of condemnation, but under the boundless grace of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Because of His work, I am free. Empower me with this freedom to forgive as I have been forgiven. Give me the strength to let go of the hurt and resentment that has grown, and to actively pursue peace in my marriage.</p>

    <p>I surrender this bitterness to You now. I choose to let it go and to receive Your healing grace. Help me to live out the truth of Your Word: that because I am under grace, sin and bitterness will not have dominion over me.</p>

    <p>Thank you for hearing my prayer. I trust in Your power to heal and restore.</p>

    <p class="closing">In Jesus' holy name,</p>
    <p class="closing">Amen.</p>
