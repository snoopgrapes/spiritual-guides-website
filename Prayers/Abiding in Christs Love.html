        <h1>Abiding in Christ's Love</h1>
        
        <p>Beloved Jesus,</p>
        
        <p>You call me to <span class="emphasis">remain</span> in Your love—not as a distant admirer, but as one embraced by You. 
        <span class="scripture">"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love." (John 15:9)</span></p>
        
        <p>When I feel unworthy, remind me that Your love isn't earned—it's <span class="emphasis">given freely</span>. 
        <span class="scripture">"God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)</span></p>
        
        <p>Anchor me in this truth: Nothing can separate me from Your love. 
        <span class="scripture">"Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus." (Romans 8:39)</span></p>
        
        <p>Teach me to receive Your love like a child—without suspicion, without bargaining, without trying to repay what can only be <span class="emphasis">gifted</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Let Your love flow through me to others. May I love as You love—patiently, sacrificially, without conditions. 
        <span class="scripture">"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another." (John 13:34)</span></p>
        
        <p>When I'm tempted to wander, draw me back to the safety of Your embrace. Your love is my true home.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of Jesus, the embodiment of perfect love,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
