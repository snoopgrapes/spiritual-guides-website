        <h1>The Father's Pruning</h1>
        
        <p>Heavenly Gardener,</p>
        
        <p>I come before You, trusting that even Your <span class="emphasis">cuts</span> are acts of love. 
        <span class="scripture">"Every branch that bears fruit You prune, that it may bear more fruit." (John 15:2)</span></p>
        
        <p>When Your shears remove what feels precious, help me remember: You take away to <span class="emphasis">give more</span>. 
        <span class="scripture">"He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His holiness." (Hebrews 12:10)</span></p>
        
        <p>Give me courage to surrender what You're trimmingâ€”relationships, comforts, even good things that aren't <span class="emphasis">Your best</span> for me.</p>
        
        <p>Where the wound is fresh, pour Your healing balm. Where I'm tempted to resent the loss, plant deeper trust. 
        <span class="scripture">"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." (Job 1:21)</span></p>
        
        <p>Shape me through this sacred suffering. Let every cut expose more of Christ in me. 
        <span class="scripture">"Though now for a little while you may have to suffer grief in various trials, this is so the tested genuineness of your faith may be found to result in praise and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ." (1 Peter 1:6-7)</span></p>
        
        <p>I choose to believe that this temporary pain prepares me for eternal weight of glory. Keep me abiding as You cultivate Christlikeness in me.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of Jesus, the Perfectly Pruned One,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
