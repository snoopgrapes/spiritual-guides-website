        <h1>A Prayer for Patience and Trust in God's Timing</h1>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
            
            <p>Thank You for Your perfect wisdom and unfailing love. Your Word reminds me that <em>"Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly"</em> (Proverbs 14:29). Help me to walk in this wisdom, trusting that Your timing is always right.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                When delays and frustrations come, remind me to pause and ask, <strong>"What are You teaching me in this waiting?"</strong>
            </div>
            
            <p>Keep me from haste and worry, and instead, fill me with faith that You are working all things for my good. As Ecclesiastes 7:8 says, <em>"The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride."</em> Let me find peace in Your process, knowing that Your plans are worth waiting for.</p>
            
            <p>Lord, when my heart grows restless, anchor me in Your promises. Teach me to surrender my timeline to You, believing that what You have prepared is far greater than what I can see. May my patience be a reflection of my trust in You.</p>
            
            <p class="signature">In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
