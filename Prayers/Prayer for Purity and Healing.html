        <h1>A Prayer for Healing from Sexual Sin</h1>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            "But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."<br>
            <strong>— James 1:14-15</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            "It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God."<br>
            <strong>— 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="focus-question">
            "What am I really seeking when I turn to lustful desires?"
        </div>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            Heavenly Father, I come before You humbled and broken, acknowledging that the sexual sin in my life is but a symptom of deeper wounds. You see beyond my outward struggles to the pain, loneliness, or bitterness that may be fueling them. Reveal to me the true roots of my temptation.
        </div>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            Lord, I confess that I have often treated lust as the main problem, when in truth it is merely the fruit of something deeper—unhealed hurts, unmet needs, or misplaced longings. Shine Your light into the hidden places of my heart and show me what I'm truly seeking when I turn to impure thoughts or actions.
        </div>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            Where there is bitterness, plant forgiveness. Where there is emptiness, fill me with Your Spirit. Where there is brokenness, bring Your healing. Help me to understand that my deepest desires are ultimately for You—for love, acceptance, and connection that only Christ can fully satisfy.
        </div>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            Give me the courage to face the root issues rather than just battling the symptoms. Grant me wisdom to see the lies I've believed and strength to replace them with Your truth. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
        </div>
        
        <div class="prayer-text">
            May I find in You what I've been seeking elsewhere. Teach me to bring my whole self—my hurts, my needs, my desires—honestly before You, trusting in Your perfect love and provision.
        </div>
        
        <div class="closing">
            In Jesus' name, Amen.

            Lust Is the Fruit Not the Root
