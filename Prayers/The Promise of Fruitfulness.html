        <h1>The Promise of Fruitfulness</h1>
        
        <p>Father God,</p>
        
        <p>Thank You for Your <span class="emphasis">promise</span> that when I abide in Christ, fruit will come. 
        <span class="scripture">"This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples." (John 15:8)</span></p>
        
        <p>I confess my impatienceâ€”wanting visible results on my timeline. Teach me to trust Your process, knowing You're at work even when I can't see it. 
        <span class="scripture">"The seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how." (Mark 4:27)</span></p>
        
        <p>Prune whatever hinders Your purposes in me, even when it's painful. Make me a vessel for <span class="emphasis">lasting</span> fruit. 
        <span class="scripture">"Every branch that does bear fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit." (John 15:2)</span></p>
        
        <p>Let my life produce the fruit of Your Spirit: 
        <span class="scripture">"Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control." (Galatians 5:22-23)</span></p>
        
        <p>Use me to sow seeds of hope in others, believing Your word never returns void. 
        <span class="scripture">"So shall My word be that goes out from My mouth; it shall not return to Me empty." (Isaiah 55:11)</span></p>
        
        <p>Jesus, my True Vine, I yield to Your life in me. May Your fruit grow <span class="emphasis">naturally</span> from our connection, not my striving.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of the One who makes all things fruitful,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
