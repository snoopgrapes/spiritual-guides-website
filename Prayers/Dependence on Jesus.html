        <h1>Jesus, Help Me Understand My Complete Dependence on You</h1>
        
        <p>Lord Jesus, my Savior and Sustainer,</p>
        
        <p>I come before You with a humble heart, acknowledging that without You, I can do nothing. 
        <span class="scripture">"Apart from me, you can do nothing." (John 15:5)</span></p>
        
        <p>Open my eyes to see my utter need for You in every moment—for breath, for wisdom, for strength, and for grace.</p>
        
        <p>Like a branch depends on the vine, teach me to abide in You. 
        <span class="scripture">"Remain in me, as I also remain in you." (John 15:4)</span></p>
        
        <p>When I am tempted to rely on my own understanding, remind me to trust in You with all my heart. 
        <span class="scripture">"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." (Proverbs 3:5)</span></p>
        
        <p>You are the Bread of Life—feed my hungry soul. 
        <span class="scripture">"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry." (John 6:35)</span></p>
        
        <p>You are the Living Water—quench my deepest thirst. 
        <span class="scripture">"Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst." (John 4:14)</span></p>
        
        <p>You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life—lead me always. 
        <span class="scripture">"I am the way and the truth and the life." (John 14:6)</span></p>
        
        <p>Help me to say with the apostle Paul: 
        <span class="scripture">"I can do all this through him who gives me strength." (Philippians 4:13)</span></p>
        
        <p>May Your grace be sufficient for me, for Your power is made perfect in my weakness. 
        <span class="scripture">"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." (2 Corinthians 12:9)</span></p>
        
        <p>I surrender all to You, Jesus. Keep me close, dependent, and desperate for You every day.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In Your holy and precious name, I pray,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
