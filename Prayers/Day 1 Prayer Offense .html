        <h1>Prayer: The Nature of Offense</h1>
        
        <p>Lord Jesus,</p>
        
        <p>You warned us that <span class="emphasis">offenses would come</span>, but You also showed us how to overcome them. 
        <span class="scripture">"Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!" (Matthew 18:7)</span></p>
        
        <p>Forgive me for the times I've <span class="emphasis">clung to offense</span> as if it were my right, when in truth it only poisons my soul. 
        <span class="scripture">"See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no 'root of bitterness' springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled." (Hebrews 12:15)</span></p>
        
        <p>Reveal to me today any <span class="emphasis">hidden offenses</span> I'm carrying—those grudges I've nursed, those wounds I've rehearsed, those injustices I've catalogued. Shine Your light on these dark corners of my heart.</p>
        
        <p>Help me understand that <span class="emphasis">releasing offense</span> isn't excusing wrong behavior—it's freeing myself from Satan's trap. 
        <span class="scripture">"A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense." (Proverbs 19:11)</span></p>
        
        <p>Give me discernment to recognize when I'm <span class="emphasis">beginning to take offense</span>, and courage to release it immediately. Let me walk in the freedom of an unoffendable heart, secure in Your love.</p>
        
        <p class="closing">In the name of Jesus, who endured the ultimate offense for my sake,<br><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
