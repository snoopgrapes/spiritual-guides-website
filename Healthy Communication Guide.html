        <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
        <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
        <p>We come before You humbly, asking for Your wisdom and grace as we have this conversation. Soften our hearts with Your love, and help us to ‘be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry’ (James 1:19).</p>
        <p>Lord, guard our words—may they ‘give grace to those who hear’ (Ephesians 4:29). Where we’ve wounded one another, give us courage to repent; where we feel hurt, help us to extend forgiveness.</p>
        <p>Remind us that ‘love is patient, love is kind’ (1 Corinthians 13:4), and teach us to speak truth in love. Let Your peace rule in our hearts as we seek healing today.</p>
        <p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

        <h2>Harsh Words & Criticism</h2>
        
        <h3>Generalizing & Exaggerating</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"You never listen or understand me or my POV"</li>
            <li>"You always control or takeover everything"</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">Using absolute statements (always/never) would have made you feel like I had completely ignored your efforts to do so, dismissing the times when you did try. These exaggerations would have felt like an attack and not communication making you feel criticised as a person. Making you feel like the enemy causing you to withdraw and emotionally shutdown.</p>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            <p>"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear." (Ephesians 4:29)</p>
            <p>"A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." (Proverbs 15:1)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="approach">
            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <p>"I realize my words have wounded you. I regret speaking in ways that made you feel attacked. I want to change that."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sarcasm & Mockery</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pulling faces and mocking tones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">Is a form of contempt. Extreme toxic behaviour. Sends the message I don't take you or your feelings seriously. It would have belittled you. Wounding you. Laughing at your emotions rather than acknowledged. Eroding trust and safety in the relationship. Resentment grows. Causing you to suppress your emotions, avoid sharing your feelings. Causing you to grow cold and detached.</p>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            <p>"Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude." (1 Corinthians 13:4-5)</p>
            <p>"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up." (Ephesians 4:29)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="approach">
            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <p>"My sarcasm was wrong—it made you feel belittled. That's not how love acts, and I'm sorry."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Name Calling & Insults</h2>
        <p>(Verbal Abuse erodes love, trust and emotional safety)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fake Christian (Direct attack on your identity. Personal assault.)</li>
            <li>Angel Wings - "Weaponized faith, making you feel spiritually judged."</li>
            <li>Controlling - "Manipulation tactics. Silence the other person. Making you feel afraid to express your needs."</li>
            <li>Feminist - "Shift blame to avoid accountability by labeling you as 'the problem'"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why I Resort to Name-Calling?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unprocessed Anger</strong> – They can't articulate their emotions, so they lash out.</li>
            <li><strong>Contempt</strong> – A sign of deep disrespect.</li>
            <li><strong>Learned Behavior</strong> – Grew up in households where insults were "normal."</li>
            <li><strong>Desire to "Win"</strong> – Using hurtful words to dominate the argument.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Dismissive & Belittling Remarks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Comments to belittle your knowledge on Jesus. Especially in front of kids. If unknowingly, then not being quick to apologise to set a good and positive model for the kids.</li>
            <li>Saying you wouldn't understand and why even bother as you don't listen anyway.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">Dismissing your understanding of faith. Sending the message that your perspective is worthless and your faith/intelligence is inferior. Form of humiliation infront of the kids. Undermining your authority as a parent. Models disrespect as normal behavior. Creates confusion in kids seeing one parent dualing with the other.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Do Partners Act This Way?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pride & Control</strong> – They need to feel intellectually or spiritually "superior."</li>
            <li><strong>Unresolved Anger</strong> – Belittling is often a passive-aggressive way to express frustration.</li>
            <li><strong>Learned Behavior</strong> – Grew up in homes where dismissiveness was normalized.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Accountability</strong> – Refusing to apologize keeps them in a position of power.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            <p>"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." (Philippians 2:3)</p>
            <p>"Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others." (Philippians 2:4)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="approach">
            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <p>"When I dismissed your thoughts, I was prideful. Your perspective matters deeply to me."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Comparisons & Shaming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Referring to past relationships to suggest they were better than ours. Therefore, suggesting or implying the person in them was better than you</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">Emotional and psycological harm. Causing feelings of inadequacy and rejection. Sends the message you don't measure up or I settled for you. Can breed insecurity, jealousy or resentment. Humilation & Betrayal. Comparisons are a form of public shaming even if done privately. Make you feel you are in a competition you didn't sign up for or that I wished I was with someone else. Eroding intimacy, withdrawing emotionally and physically. Relationship stops becoming about us 2 now haunted by ghosts of the past. Undermines commitment. Raising doubts "Are they still emotionally attached to their ex?", "Do they truly want this marriage?"</p>
        
        <h3>Why Do Partners Do This?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manipulation Tactic</strong> – Using guilt to control behavior ("Be more like them, or else").</li>
            <li><strong>Immature Conflict Style</strong> – Instead of addressing issues directly, they use comparisons as a weapon.</li>
            <li><strong>Unhappiness Projection</strong> – Their dissatisfaction with themselves leaks out as criticism of you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="scripture">
            <p>"Love keeps no record of wrongs." (1 Corinthians 13:5)</p>
            <p>"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up." (1 Thessalonians 5:11)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="approach">
            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <p>"Bringing up the past was unfair. You are God's gift to me, and I don't want you to feel second-best."</p>

    <div class="section">

            <p>Scripture: "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths but only what builds up".</p>

        <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
        <p>Gracious God,</p>
        <p>Thank You for walking with us in this conversation. Where words fell short or emotions rose, cover us with Your mercy. Help us to ‘bear with one another in love’ (Ephesians 4:2) and to ‘let the peace of Christ rule in our hearts’ (Colossians 3:15).</p>
        <p>Lord, plant these truths deep within us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To speak life, not destruction (Proverbs 18:21),</li>
            <li>To listen with humility (Philippians 2:3),</li>
            <li>To forgive as You’ve forgiven us (Colossians 3:13).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heal what’s been broken between us, and strengthen our bond with Your love—patient, kind, and unshakable (1 Corinthians 13:7). May every word from now on reflect Your grace.</p>
        <p>We trust this to You, our Redeemer. Amen.</p>
