    <h1>Covenant vs. Contract: A Biblical Study of Marriage</h1>

    <section id="definition">
        <h2>Definition: Covenant vs. Contract</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Contract: A Conditional, Temporary Agreement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> A legally binding agreement based on mutual conditions ("If you do this, I'll do that").</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Temporary—lasts only as long as terms are fulfilled.</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Can be voided if obligations aren't met.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Transactional—centered on rights and benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Business deals, employment agreements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Covenant: A Sacred, Unbreakable Bond</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> A solemn commitment before God, relational rather than transactional.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent and unbreakable—based on faithfulness.</li>
            <li><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="verse-popup">Noahic Covenant (<span class="verse-ref">Genesis 9:8-17</span>)<span class="popup-text"><strong>Genesis 9:8-17</strong><br>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every living creature that was with you... I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth."</span></span>: God's promise never to flood the earth again.</li>
                    <li><span class="verse-popup">Abrahamic Covenant (<span class="verse-ref">Genesis 15, 17</span>)<span class="popup-text"><strong>Genesis 15:5-6</strong><br>He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be." Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</span></span>: God's pledge to make Abraham the father of many nations.</li>
                    <li><span class="verse-popup">Davidic Covenant (<span class="verse-ref">2 Samuel 7:12-16</span>)<span class="popup-text"><strong>2 Samuel 7:12-13</strong><br>"When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."</span></span>: God's promise of an eternal dynasty through David's lineage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="verse-popup">Marriage as a Covenant (<span class="verse-ref">Malachi 2:14</span>)<span class="popup-text"><strong>Malachi 2:14</strong><br>You ask, "Why?" It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.</span></span>: God calls marriage a "covenant partnership."</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Why It Matters Today</h3>
            <p>Modern relationships often operate like contracts—focused on personal gain and easy exits. Biblical covenants model <span class="highlight">unwavering commitment, trust, and sacrificial love</span>, reflecting God's faithfulness.</p>
            <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In <strong>marriage</strong>, prioritize covenant loyalty over contractual thinking.</li>
                <li>In <strong>faith</strong>, remember God's covenants are unchanging (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">Hebrews 6:18</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>Hebrews 6:18</strong><br>God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.</span></span>).</li>
                <li>In <strong>relationships</strong>, value commitment over convenience.</li>

        <h3>1. <span class="verse-popup">Genesis 2:24<span class="popup-text"><strong>Genesis 2:24</strong><br>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</span></span> – The Divine Blueprint</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leaving & Cleaving:</strong> New primary loyalty—spouses prioritize each other.</li>
            <li><strong>One-Flesh Union:</strong> Spiritual, emotional, and covenantal unity (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">Mark 10:8-9</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>Mark 10:8-9</strong><br>and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.</span></span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Permanence:</strong> Designed by God to be lifelong.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. <span class="verse-popup">Ephesians 5:31-32<span class="popup-text"><strong>Ephesians 5:31-32</strong><br>"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.</span></span> – Marriage Reflects Christ & Church</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Covenant Love:</strong> Christ's sacrificial love models marital commitment.</li>
            <li><strong>Sacramental Significance:</strong> Marriage is a living symbol of the Gospel.</li>
            <li><strong>Unbreakable Bond:</strong> Mirrors Christ's unconditional commitment to the Church.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. <span class="verse-popup">Proverbs 2:17<span class="popup-text"><strong>Proverbs 2:17</strong><br>who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.</span></span> – Adultery as Covenant Treason</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divine Covenant:</strong> Adultery breaks faith with God, the ultimate witness.</li>
            <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Spiritual brokenness (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">1 Corinthians 6:18</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>1 Corinthians 6:18</strong><br>Flee from sexual immorality.

            <h3>Discussion Question</h3>
            <p><em>How can couples today practically live out the "one flesh" principle in a culture that prioritizes individualism?</em></p>
			<li>Couples can live out the "one flesh" principle by rejecting individualism and instead pursuing oneness through shared decisions, sacrificial love, and spiritual unity, just as Christ is united with the Church. This means prioritizing "we" over "me," serving one another selflessly, and guarding their covenant against cultural pressures that undermine lifelong commitment.</li>

        <h2>Historical & Theological Views on Marriage</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Augustine & the Medieval Church: Sacramental Bond</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Threefold Good of Marriage:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Procreation (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">Genesis 1:28</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>Genesis 1:28</strong><br>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it."</span></span>)</li>
                    <li>Fidelity</li>
                    <li>Sacrament (visible sign of grace)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>No Divorce:</strong> Annulments were rare exceptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Reformers: Holy Covenant, Not Sacrament</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Luther & Calvin:</strong> Marriage instituted by God but not a salvific sacrament.</li>
            <li><strong>Permitted Divorce:</strong> Only for adultery or abandonment (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">Matthew 19:9</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>Matthew 19:9</strong><br>I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.</span></span>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Modern Secular View: Revocable Contract</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No-Fault Divorce:</strong> Marriage treated as a personal fulfillment arrangement.</li>
            <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> ~50% divorce rate, weakened family structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="discussion-box">
            <h3>Discussion Question</h3>
            <p><em>How can the Church today reclaim a covenantal view of marriage in a secularized world?</em></p>
			<li>The Church must boldly teach and model marriage as a sacred covenant by grounding couples in Scripture, fostering accountability through discipleship, and celebrating marriages that reflect Christ’s faithfulness.This means equipping spouses to reject cultural compromises, providing mentorship for struggling couples, and publicly upholding the beauty of lifelong commitment as a gospel witness. </li>

        <h2>Modern Challenges to Marriage & Biblical Response</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Cultural Shifts Undermining Covenant Marriage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cohabitation:</strong> 70% of couples live together first (higher divorce risk).</li>
            <li><strong>No-Fault Divorce:</strong> Treats marriage as revocable (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">Malachi 2:16</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>Malachi 2:16</strong><br>"The man who hates and divorces his wife," says the Lord, the God of Israel, "does violence to the one he should protect," says the Lord Almighty.

            <li><strong>Redefinition:</strong> Detached from biblical design of one man + one woman.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Biblical Response</h3>

            <h3>Practical Application</h3>
            <p><strong>For Married Couples:</strong></p>

            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>For the Church:</strong></p>
            <ol>

                <li>Provide mentoring for couples</li>
                <li>Support struggling marriages (<span class="verse-popup"><span class="verse-ref">James 5:16</span><span class="popup-text"><strong>James 5:16</strong><br>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
