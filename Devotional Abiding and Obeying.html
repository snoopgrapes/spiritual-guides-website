    <p>Obedience is the natural result of abiding</p>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üìñ</span> Scripture</h2>
    <div class="scripture">
      <p><strong>John 15:10-14 (ESV)</strong></p>
      <p>"If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."</p>

      <p><strong>What commands of Christ do I find difficult to obey?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Jesus reveals the beautiful <span class="highlight">cycle of abiding and obeying</span>: We obey because we abide, and our abiding deepens through obedience. Common challenging commands include:</p>
      
      <div class="command-list">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Love enemies</strong> (Matthew 5:44) - Bless those who oppose you</li>
          <li><strong>Take up your cross</strong> (Luke 9:23) - Daily surrender</li>
          <li><strong>Forgive 70x7</strong> (Matthew 18:22) - Unlimited mercy</li>
          <li><strong>Seek first God's kingdom</strong> (Matthew 6:33) - Reordered priorities</li>
          <li><strong>Make disciples</strong> (Matthew 28:19) - Intentional multiplication</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="obedience-cycle">
        <span>ABIDE</span> ‚Üí <span>HEAR</span> ‚Üí <span>OBEY</span> ‚Üí <span>DEEPER ABIDING</span>
      </div>
      
      <blockquote>
        "Obedience is the fruit of abiding; abiding is the root of obedience."
        <br>- Andrew Murray
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Key insight: Jesus mentions <strong>joy</strong> (v.11) between His commands about obedience and love - showing that surrendered obedience brings delight, not drudgery.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úã</span> Practice</h2>
    <div class="practice-box">
      <p><strong>Obey one prompting from the Spirit today.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>How to cultivate responsive obedience:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare</strong>: Pray "Holy Spirit, make me sensitive to Your voice today"</li>
        <li><strong>Pause</strong> when you sense a nudge (to pray, serve, speak, or refrain)</li>
        <li><strong>Prompt</strong>: Ask "Is this from You, Lord?" (Test against Scripture)</li>
        <li><strong>Perform</strong> the action within 24 hours (delayed obedience is disobedience)</li>
        <li><strong>Process</strong>: Journal what happened and how it affected your abiding</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><em>Examples of promptings:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call someone who comes to mind</li>
        <li>Apologize to a person you wronged</li>
        <li>Give anonymously to a need</li>
        <li>Fast from something that distracts you from God</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üôè</span> Prayer</h2>
    <div class="prayer-box">
      <p>"Jesus, help my obedience flow naturally from abiding in You. Break my addiction to self-rule that resists Your commands. Train me to recognize Your voice quickly and respond immediately. When obedience feels costly, remind me that Your commands are the path to abiding deeper in Your love. Give me courage to obey today in one area I've resisted. May my small yeses prepare me for greater surrender. Keep me from legalism that obeys to earn love rather than because I'm already loved. Let my life prove that Your yoke is easy and Your burden is light. Amen."</p>
