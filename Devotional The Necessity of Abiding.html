    <h1>üåø Day 2: The Necessity of Abiding</h1>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úùÔ∏è</span> Theme</h2>
    <p>Apart from Christ, we can do nothing</p>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üìñ</span> Scripture</h2>
    <div class="scripture">
      <p><strong>John 15:4-6 (ESV)</strong></p>
      <p>"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üîç</span> Focus</h2>
    <div class="focus-box">
      <p><strong>Where have I been trying to live independently of Christ?</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus makes a radical claim: <em>"Apart from me you can do nothing"</em> (v.5). This challenges our cultural emphasis on self-sufficiency. Consider these areas:</p>
      
      <ul class="reflection-questions">
        <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Do I seek God's wisdom or rely solely on my own understanding?</li>
        <li><strong>Daily work:</strong> Am I working <em>for</em> God or <em>apart from</em> God?</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Do I depend on Christ's love flowing through me?</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Where am I striving in my own strength rather than abiding?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The Greek word for "abide" (ŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâ/men≈ç) means to remain, stay, or dwell. It implies an ongoing, intentional connection‚Äînot occasional visits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úã</span> Practice</h2>
    <div class="practice-box">
      <p><strong>Before each task today, whisper:</strong> "I can do this through Christ who strengthens me." (Philippians 4:13)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Practical steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pause for 5 seconds before starting any activity</li>
        <li>Whisper the phrase (or say it silently)</li>
        <li>Visualize Christ's life flowing through you like sap in a vine</li>
        <li>Proceed with conscious dependence</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><em>Tip:</em> Set phone reminders for key transition times (morning, lunch, evening).</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üôè</span> Prayer</h2>
    <div class="prayer-box">
      <p>"Lord, reveal areas where I rely on my own strength rather than abiding in You. Forgive me for the pride of self-sufficiency. Expose the subtle ways I disconnect from You throughout my day. Teach me what it means to remain in You constantly‚Äînot just during 'spiritual' moments but in ordinary tasks, conversations, and decisions. May Your life flow through me today in everything I do. I acknowledge that apart from You, I can do nothing of eternal value. Help me live in this truth. Amen."</p>
