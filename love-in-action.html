    <h1>How to Demonstrate Love When You Don't Feel Like It</h1>
    
    <p>Based on <strong>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</strong>, here's how to show love even when the feelings aren't there:</p>
    
    <div class="verse">
        "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails." (NIV)
    </div>
    
    <h2>Practical Ways to Demonstrate Love</h2>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>1. Choose Patience (v. 4)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> When irritated, pause before reacting. Give others time and grace, even if they frustrate you.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of snapping at a slow coworker, take a deep breath and respond kindly.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>2. Act with Kindness (v. 4)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Do something small but intentional—a smile, a helpful gesture, or an encouraging word.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Send a text to someone you're struggling with, just to say, "Hope you're doing okay."
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>3. Reject Envy & Pride (v. 4-5)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Celebrate others' successes, even if you feel jealous. Refuse to keep score in relationships.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Compliment someone who got what you wanted, sincerely.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>4. Let Go of Rudeness & Selfishness (v. 5)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Listen instead of interrupting. Prioritize others' needs over your convenience.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Let someone go ahead of you in line, even if you're in a hurry.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>5. Release Resentment (v. 5)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Refuse to dwell on past hurts. Pray for the person who wronged you.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Say, "I choose to forgive," even if the feeling isn't there yet.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>6. Delight in Truth (v. 6)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Be honest but gentle. Avoid gossip, even when it's tempting.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Change the subject when others are unfairly criticized.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-box">
        <h3>7. Persevere (v. 7-8)</h3>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> Show up consistently, even when love feels like a duty. Trust that feelings may follow actions.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Keep serving your family or community, even when it's unappreciated.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="reminder">
        <p><strong>Key Reminder:</strong> Biblical love (<em>agape</em>) is a <strong>choice</strong>, not just an emotion. Jesus loved us "while we were still sinners" (Romans 5:8)—He acted first, feelings followed. When you obey God in loving others, He often softens your heart over time.</p>
