    <h2><span class="icon">‚úùÔ∏è</span> Theme</h2>
    <p>Abiding leads to bearing much fruit</p>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üìñ</span> Scripture</h2>
    <div class="scripture">
      <p><strong>John 15:5-8 (ESV)</strong></p>
      <p>"I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples."</p>
      <p><strong>Galatians 5:22-23 (ESV)</strong></p>
      <p>"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law."</p>

      <p><strong>What fruit is Christ producing in my life?</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus promises that abiding leads to <span class="highlight">"much fruit"</span> (John 15:5) - not just occasional good deeds, but a consistent Christlike character. The Greek word for fruit (<em>karpos</em>) implies visible, tangible results of spiritual life.</p>

      <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Which fruit feels most evident in your life right now? Which feels most scarce? Remember - fruit grows <em>naturally</em> from abiding, not through self-effort.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">‚úã</span> Practice</h2>
    <div class="practice-box">
      <p><strong>Identify one fruit of the Spirit to intentionally cultivate today.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose <strong>one fruit</strong> from Galatians 5:22-23 that you want to see more evident in your life</li>
        <li>Create a <strong>simple reminder</strong> (note on your phone, bracelet, sticky note)</li>
        <li>Look for <strong>3 opportunities</strong> to express this fruit today</li>
        <li>At day's end, <strong>journal</strong> how Christ produced this fruit through you</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><em>Example:</em> If choosing <strong>kindness</strong>, you might: (1) Let someone go ahead in line, (2) Send an encouraging text, (3) Listen attentively to a colleague.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><span class="icon">üôè</span> Prayer</h2>
    <div class="prayer-box">
      <p>"Father, produce Your fruit in me as I remain in Christ. I confess my tendency to manufacture artificial fruit through self-effort rather than abiding in the Vine. Thank You that spiritual fruit is Your work, not mine. As I stay connected to Jesus today, make His love flow through me. Highlight one aspect of Christ's character You want to grow in me, and give me eyes to see opportunities to express it. May others taste Your goodness through my life, bringing glory to You. Keep me from pride when fruit appears, remembering it's all by Your grace. Amen."</p>
